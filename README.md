# hello-world
My Hello World project by suggestion of the "GitHub Guides" system.

Peace to all :) I am Oleksiy from Ukraine. I am here to know how the Git-system works and how I can use it to do either multi-version coding or some other projects which are changed by nature ! I hope to find this well-known versioning system useful for me and my colleagues !

Thank you for your attention :)

==> So, this is my first change to the repository !!! I have written about myself and why I am here.
